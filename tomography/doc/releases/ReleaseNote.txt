Modules
- ConfigBase: Added user info in the copying code
- Started construction of variable handling

ImagingAlgorithms
- Class for ReferenceImageCorrection implemented with BB correction.
- Added prototype for detector lag correction

- Added module with general convolution filter


Back projector modules
- Added FDK reconstruction

Muhrec application
