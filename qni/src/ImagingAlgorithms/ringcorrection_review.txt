AB This paper reports a simple but effective filtering approach to deal
   with single-crystal artefacts in X-ray diffraction computed tomography
   (XRD-CT). In XRD-CT, large crystallites can produce spots on top of the
   powder diffraction rings, which, after azimuthal integration and
   tomographic reconstruction, lead to line/streak artefacts in the
   tomograms. In the simple approach presented here, the polar transform is
   taken of collected two-dimensional diffraction patterns followed by
   directional median/mean filtering prior to integration. Reconstruction
   of one-dimensional diffraction projection data sets treated in such a
   way leads to a very significant improvement in reconstructed image
   quality for systems that exhibit powder spottiness arising from large
   crystallites. This approach is not computationally heavy which is an
   important consideration with big data sets such as is the case with
   XRD-CT. The method should have application to two-dimensional X-ray
   diffraction data in general where such spottiness arises.

AB In X-ray imaging, it is common practice to normalize the acquired
   projection data with averaged flat fields taken prior to the scan.
   Unfortunately, due to source instabilities, vibrating beamline
   components such as the monochromator, time varying detector properties,
   or other confounding factors, flat fields are often far from stationary,
   resulting in significant systematic errors in intensity normalization.
   In this work, a simple and efficient method is proposed to account for
   dynamically varying flat fields. Through principal component analysis of
   a set of flat fields, eigen flat fields are computed. A linear
   combination of the most important eigen flat fields is then used to
   individually normalize each X-ray projection. Experiments show that the
   proposed dynamic flat field correction leads to a substantial reduction
   of systematic errors in projection intensity normalization compared to
   conventional flat field correction. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America

AB Ring artifacts are a very common problem in tomographic reconstruction,
   and numerous methods exist to either pre-process the sinogram or correct
   the reconstructed slice. A novel approach to perform the correction as
   part of the reconstruction process is presented. It is shown that for
   iterative techniques, which amount to optimizing an objective function,
   the ring artifacts correction can be easily integrated in the formalism,
   enabling simultaneous slice reconstruction and ring artifacts
   correction. This method is tested and compared with mainstream
   correction techniques for both simulated and experimental data. Results
   show that the correction is efficient, especially for undersampled
   datasets. This technique is included in the PyHST2 code which is used at
   the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility for tomographic
   reconstruction.

AB OBJECTIVE: Ring artifacts often appear in flat-panel detector-based CT
   images due to the malfunction or mis-calibration of the detector
   elements that result in stripe artifacts in the line integral projection
   (sinogram) data. The ring artifacts lower the image quality and affect
   image-based diagnoses. Here we propose a ring artifacts removal approach
   based on wavelet filtering in the sinogram domain. The line integral
   projection (sinogram) dataset were divided into 4 sub-sinogram dataset,
   and for each of them the wavelet decomposition operation was employed to
   produce the associated wavelet dataset, followed by filtering operation
   on the vertical detail band and the low-pass detail band. Wavelet
   reconstruction operation was then performed, and the weighted moving
   average filter was used to yield the filtered sinogram, which was
   processed using filtered back-projection (FBP) for image reconstruction.
   The results showed that the proposed approach could effectively remove
   the ring artifacts while preserving the structural information of the
   image.

AB Hard X-ray has been widely used in medical and industrial fields because
   it can be applied to observe the inside of a sample. Computed tomography
   provides sectional images of the sample through the reconstruction of
   the projection images. The quality of sectional images strongly depends
   on that of projection images. Ring artifact appeared on the seconal
   image can be made by the abnormal pixels of the detector used. In this
   study, we examine the ring artifact ratio in the circle phantom as a
   function of detection error of the detector used in computed tomography.
   The ring artifact increased with the increment of detection error under
   parallel and fan beam geometries and strongly increased near the center
   of rotation. The corrections, dead pixel and flat field corrections, for
   the images taken with the detector are required before the image
   reconstruction process to reduce the ring artifact in the computed
   tomography.

AB Ring artifacts are a common problem in computed tomography, positron
   emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and synchrotron
   radiation images. Before further processing the images such as
   segmentation and quantification, these artifacts have to be removed or
   suppressed. Otherwise, they may introduce additional errors for the
   segmentation and subsequent analysis. This paper proposes an improved
   ring artifact removal method based on biorthogonal wavelet transform,
   one-dimensional fast Fourier transform, and Gaussian damping, which is
   implemented on general-purpose computing on graphics processing unit
   with compute unified device architecture. The experimental results show
   that the proposed algorithms can be speed up several hundred times
   compared with the previous algorithms on CPU. The significant
   performance improvement makes the algorithms much more practical in
   processing large volume of images in real time. Copyright (c) 2013 John

AB Summary form only given. In this paper, a novel preprocessing technique
   is proposed for the correction of ring artifact in X-ray CT image. By
   fitting each projection in sinogram image with piecewise polynomial, a
   set of candidate correction factors for mis-calibrated detector is
   created and then the factor with maximum probability occurrence is
   picked out to rectify the projection data. Principle and procedure of
   the method is illustrated. Tests under different condition show that,
   sparse or continuous ring artifact in the CT image can both be well
   rectified effectively, while spatial resolution of the image preserved.
   CT images for multi-material object can also be corrected by the method.

AB A fast algorithm for ring artefact reduction in high-resolution
   micro-tomography with synchrotron radiation is presented. The new method
   is a generalization of the one proposed by Titarenko and collaborators,
   with a complete sinogram restoration prior to reconstruction with
   classical algorithms. The generalized algorithm can be performed in
   linear time and is easy to implement. Compared with the original
   approach, with an explicit solution, this approach is fast through the
   use of the conjugate gradient method. Also, low/high-resolution
   sinograms can be restored using higher/lower-order derivatives of the
   projections. Using different order for the derivative is an advantage
   over the classical Titarenko's approach. Several numerical results using
   the proposed method are provided, supporting our claims.

AB Ring artifacts on tomogram slices hinder image interpretation. They are
   caused by minor variation in the response from individual elements in a
   two dimensional (2D) X-ray detector. Polar space decreases the
   suppression complexity by transforming the rings on the tomogram slice
   to linear stripes. However, it requires that the center of rings lie at
   the origin of polar transformation. If this is not the case, all methods
   employing polar space become ineffective. We developed a method based on
   Gaussian localization of the ring center in Hough parameter space to
   assign the origin for the polar transformation. Thus, obtained linear
   stripes can be effectively suppressed by already existing methods. This
   effectively suppresses ring artifacts in the data from a variety of
   experimental setups, sample types and also handles tomograms that are
   previously cropped. This approach functions automatically, avoids the
   need for assumptions and preserves fine details, all critical for
   synchrotron based nanometer resolution tomography. (C) 2014 AIP

AB Purpose: In using flat panel detectors (FPD) for cone beam computed
   tomography (CBCT), pixel gain variations may lead to structured
   nonuniformities in projections and ring artifacts in CBCT images. Such
   gain variations can be caused by change in detector entrance exposure
   levels or beam hardening, and they are not accounted by conventional
   flat field correction methods. In this work, the authors presented a
   method to identify isolated pixel clusters that exhibit gain variations
   and proposed a pixel gain correction (PGC) method to suppress both beam
   hardening and exposure level dependent gain variations.
   Methods: To modulate both beam spectrum and entrance exposure, flood
   field FPD projections were acquired using beam filters with varying
   thicknesses. "Ideal" pixel values were estimated by performing
   polynomial fits in both raw and flat field corrected projections.
   Residuals were calculated by taking the difference between measured and
   ideal pixel values to identify clustered image and FPD artifacts in flat
   field corrected and raw images, respectively. To correct clustered image
   artifacts, the ratio of ideal to measured pixel values in filtered
   images were utilized as pixel-specific gain correction factors, referred
   as PGC method, and they were tabulated as a function of pixel value in a
   look-up table.
   Results: 0.035% of detector pixels lead to clustered image artifacts in
   flat field corrected projections, where 80% of these pixels were traced
   back and linked to artifacts in the FPD. The performance of PGC method
   was tested in variety of imaging conditions and phantoms. The PGC method
   reduced clustered image artifacts and fixed pattern noise in
   projections, and ring artifacts in CBCT images.
   Conclusions: Clustered projection image artifacts that lead to ring
   artifacts in CBCT can be better identified with our artifact detection
   approach. When compared to the conventional flat field correction
   method, the proposed PGC method enables characterization of nonlinear
   pixel gain variations as a function of change in x-ray spectrum and
   intensity. Hence, it can better suppress image artifacts due to beam
   hardening as well as artifacts that arise from detector entrance
   exposure variation. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in

AB Ring artifacts in computed tomography (CT) images degrade image quality
   and obscure the true shapes of objects. While several correction methods
   have been developed, their performances are often task-dependent and not
   generally applicable. Here, we propose a novel method to reduce ring
   artifacts by calculating the ratio of adjacent detector elements in the
   projection data, termed the line-ratio. Our method estimates the
   sensitivity of each detector element and equalizes them in sinogram
   space. As a result, the stripe pattern can be effectively removed from
   sinogram data, thereby also removing ring artifacts from the
   reconstructed CT image. Numerical simulations were performed to evaluate
   and compare the performance of our method with that of conventional
   methods. We also tested our method experimentally and demonstrated that
   our method has superior performance to other methods. (C) 2014 Optical

AB Ring artifacts can occur in reconstructed images from x-ray Computerized
   Tomography (CT) as full or partial concentric rings superimposed on the
   scanned structures. Due to the data corruption by those ring artifacts
   in CT images, qualitative and quantitative analysis of these images are
   compromised. In this paper, we propose to correct the ring artifacts on
   the reconstructed synchrotron radiation (SR) CT image slices. The
   proposed correction procedure includes the following steps: (1).
   transform the reconstructed CT images into polar coordinates; (2) apply
   discrete two-dimensional (2D) wavelet transform to the polar image to
   decompose it into four image components: low pass band image component,
   as well as the components from horizontal, vertical and diagonal details
   bands; (3). apply 2D Fourier transform to the vertical details band
   image component only, since the ring artifacts become vertical lines in
   the polar coordinates; (4). apply Gaussian filtering in Fourier domain
   along the abscissa direction to suppress the vertical lines, since the
   information of the vertical lines in Fourier domain is completely
   condensed to that direction; (5). perform inverse Fourier transform to
   get the corrected vertical details band image component; (6). perform
   inverse wavelet transform to get the corrected polar image; (7).
   transform the corrected polar image back to Cartesian coordinates to get
   the CT image slice with reduced ring artifacts. This approach has been
   successfully used on CT data acquired from the Biomedical Imaging and
   Therapy (BMIT) beamline in Canadian Light Source (CLS), and the results
   show that the ring artifacts in original SR CT images have been
   effectively suppressed with all the structure information in the image
   preserved.

AB Ring artifacts often appear in flat-panel detector based CT images due
   to the malfunction and mis-calibration of detector elements resulting in
   stripe artifacts in the sinogram data. In this paper, we propose an
   improved ring artifacts removal (IRAR) approach by combining
   multi-resolution analysis and weighted moving average filter methods.
   Specifically, the multi-resolution analysis method can suppress these
   high-intensity vertical stripes in the sinogram domain and the moving
   average filter method is effective to deal with the relatively
   high-intensity vertical stripes. Experimental results on the data
   acquired from a commercial micro-CT scanner show that the presented
   approach can achieve significant gains over the existing methods in the
   ring artifacts removal while preserving spatial resolution.

   Although digital image processing approaches to ring artifacts removal
   via direct filtering of the reconstructed images exist, in synchrotron
   radiation microtomography this issue is usually faced during the actual
   reconstruction process by de-striping the sinogram image. In this work
   different de-striping algorithms are discussed and preliminary compared
   using a suitably created test image as well as actual imaged data.
   Because of the increasing need for fast reconstruction workflows,
   details of the implementation and the related computational aspects are

   stripe artifacts in the sinogram data. In this paper, we propose an
   improved ring artifacts removal (IRAR) approach by combining
   multi-resolution analysis and weighted moving average filter methods.
   Specifically, the multi-resolution analysis method can suppress these
   high-intensity vertical stripes in the sinogram domain and the moving
   average filter method is effective to deal with the relatively
   high-intensity vertical stripes. Experimental results on the data
   acquired from a commercial micro-CT scanner show that the presented
   approach can achieve significant gains over the existing methods in the
   ring artifacts removal while preserving spatial resolution.

AB OBJECTIVE: To propose a new method for effectively and rapidly removing
   the ring artifacts in CT images based on image post-processing.
   METHODS: The CT image with ring artifacts in the Cartesian coordinate
   was first transformed into an image with line artifacts in the polar
   coordinate. The image in the polar coordinate was then filtered by
   designing a one-dimensional filter to calculate the mean and variance of
   each pixel after filtering, which were compared with the variance
   threshold value and the pixel threshold value to determine the position
   of the artifacts for corrections accordingly. Finally, the polar
   coordinate image was converted into Cartesian coordinate image.
   RESULTS: Simulated and actual CT data experimental results demonstrated
   the efficiency of this method for removing artifacts, retaining the
   image fidelity and reducing the processing time.
   CONCLUSION: The new method can accurately recognize the position of the
   artifacts and effectively remove them to facilitate the clinical
   diagnosis.

AB In this paper, a novel technique based on morphological filtering is
   proposed for the detection and removal of ring artifacts with different
   patterns, e.g., sharp isolated rings with varying intensity, isolated
   light rings, and band rings, from the mu- and/or C-Arm CT images. To
   optimize the performance of our ring removal algorithm, three different
   types of iterative morphological filters (IMFs) are proposed here for
   different ring patterns. All the IMFs detect the positions of the
   defective detector elements using the mean curve constructed from the
   corrupted sinogram. However, the basic principle of sinogram correction
   differs. For the elimination of sharp intense rings, the IMF is directly
   applied on the raw projection data for each angle of view, whereas in
   other cases an estimate of the ring-noise-free mean curve is first
   obtained to remove the ring generating artifacts from the sinogram data
   through a normalization process. The effectiveness of the proposed IMFs
   is tested for a variety of mu-CT acquired images. Experimental results
   show that the IMFs perform better than the previously reported
   techniques in the removal of ring artifacts from real mu-CT images.

AB Ring artifacts are common in tomography reconstructions. These artifacts
   may arise, in microtomography using synchrotron radiation, from dead
   pixels in CCD detectors, damaged scintillator screens and instabilities
   of the synchrotron beam. Ring artifact removal is therefore an important
   task. We apply an image inpainting algorithm on the sinogram data to
   reduce ring artifacts in reconstructions. The applied image inpainting
   algorithm is advantageous in two aspects. First, the proposed method is
   local, and it affects only the user-specified corrupted region. Second,
   it utilizes the directional information of level lines, as well as the
   intensity information, in the sinogram data. Experimental results show
   that the proposed method is able to compensate both the missing
   directional information and the distorted intensity information, which
   reduces ring artifacts in reconstructions. An improvement in
   reconstruction image qualities is achieved for micro-tomography using
   the proposed method. A comparison shows that the proposed method may
   outperform existing methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy.

AB In high resolution computed tomography (CT) using flat panel detectors,
   imperfect or defected detector elements cause stripe artifacts in
   sinogram which results in concentric ring artifacts in the image. Such
   ring artifacts obscure image details in the regions of interest of the
   image. In this article, novel techniques are proposed for the detection,
   classification, and correction of ring artifacts in the sinogram domain.
   The proposed method is suitable for multislice CT with parallel or fan
   beam geometry. It can also be employed for ring artifact removal in 3D
   cone beam volume CT by adopting a sinogram by sinogram processing
   technique. The detection algorithm is based on applying data driven
   thresholds on the mean curve and difference curve of the sinogram. The
   ring artifacts are classified into three types and a separate correction
   algorithm is used for each class. The performance of the proposed
   techniques is evaluated on a number of real micro-CT images.
   Experimental results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can remove
   ring artifacts from micro-CT images more effectively as compared to
   other recently reported techniques in the literature.

AB Ring artifacts appear in computed tomography images if there are too
   large inhomogeneities between different detector elements. The question
   of how large inhomogeneities are acceptable is gaining in importance due
   to the development of energy discriminating photon counting CT, where
   detector homogeneity is an important design parameter. We propose using
   the systematic-to-statistical error quotient q, defined as the variance
   of the expected log-normalized count number between detector elements
   (dels) divided by the variance of log-normalized count numbers measured
   with the same del, as a metric of ring artifact visibility. With a
   simple observer study using simulated images, it is shown that rings are
   visible in the reconstructed image if q exceeds a threshold which lies
   close to 1.2 . 10(-3) for 1500 detector elements and 2000 projection
   angles. It is also shown by visual inspection of simulated images that
   the threshold value is, to a good approximation, inversely proportional
   to the number of angle measurements and independent of the number of
   detector elements. The results suggest that a simple oberver study,
   together with these scaling relationships, is sufficient for
   establishing sinogram homogeneity requirements for a particular
   reconstruction method.

AB The use of an x-ray flat panel detector is increasingly becoming popular
   in 3D cone beam volume CT machines. Due to the deficient semiconductor
   array manufacturing process, the cone beam projection data are often
   corrupted by different types of abnormalities, which cause severe ring
   and radiant artifacts in a cone beam reconstruction image, and as a
   result, the diagnostic image quality is degraded. In this paper, a novel
   technique is presented for the correction of error in the 2D cone beam
   projections due to abnormalities often observed in 2D x-ray flat panel
   detectors. Template images are derived from the responses of the
   detector pixels using their statistical properties and then an effective
   non-causal derivative-based detection algorithm in 2D space is presented
   for the detection of defective and mis-calibrated detector elements
   separately. An image inpainting-based 3D correction scheme is proposed
   for the estimation of responses of defective detector elements, and the
   responses of the mis-calibrated detector elements are corrected using
   the normalization technique. For real-time implementation, a
   simplification of the proposed off-line method is also suggested.
   Finally, the proposed algorithms are tested using different real cone
   beam volume CT images and the experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed methods can effectively remove ring and radiant artifacts from
   cone beam volume CT images compared to other reported techniques in the
   literature.

AB UNLABELLED: This paper proposes a 2-step image reconstruction method in
   which the nonnegativity constraint in the iterative maximum-likelihood
   expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm is used to effectively reduce
   Gibbs ringing artifacts.
   METHODS: Gibbs artifacts are difficult to control during imaging
   reconstruction. The proposed method uses the postprocessing strategy to
   suppress Gibbs artifacts. In the first step, a raw image is
   reconstructed from projections without correction for point spread
   function (PSF). The attenuation correction can be performed in the first
   step by using, for example, the iterative MLEM or ordered-subsets
   expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithm. The second step is a
   postprocessing procedure that corrects for the PSF blurring effect. If
   the target features (e.g., hot lesions) have a positive background,
   removing the background before application of the postprocessing filter
   significantly helps with target deblurring and Gibbs artifact
   suppression. This postprocessing filter is the image-domain MLEM
   algorithm. The background activity is attached back to the foreground
   after lesion sharpening.
   RESULTS: Computer simulations and PET phantom studies were performed
   using the proposed 2-step method. The background removal strategy
   significantly reduced Gibbs artifacts.
   CONCLUSION: Gibbs ringing artifacts generated during image
   reconstruction are difficult to avoid if compensation for the PSF of the
   system is needed. The strategy of separating image reconstruction from
   PSF compensation has been shown effective in removal of Gibbs ringing
   artifacts.

AB Background: Ring artifacts are the concentric rings superimposed on the
   tomographic images often caused by the defective and insufficient
   calibrated detector elements as well as by the damaged scintillator
   crystals of the flat panel detector. It may be also generated by objects
   attenuating X-rays very differently in different projection direction.
   Ring artifact reduction techniques so far reported in the literature can
   be broadly classified into two groups. One category of the approaches is
   based on the sinogram processing also known as the pre-processing
   techniques and the other category of techniques perform processing on
   the 2-D reconstructed images, recognized as the post-processing
   techniques in the literature. The strength and weakness of these
   categories of approaches are yet to be explored from a common platform.
   Method: In this paper, a comparative study of the two categories of ring
   artifact reduction techniques basically designed for the multi-slice CT
   instruments is presented from a common platform. For comparison, two
   representative algorithms from each of the two categories are selected
   from the published literature. A very recently reported state-of-the-art
   sinogram domain ring artifact correction method that classifies the ring
   artifacts according to their strength and then corrects the artifacts
   using class adaptive correction schemes is also included in this
   comparative study. The first sinogram domain correction method uses a
   wavelet based technique to detect the corrupted pixels and then using a
   simple linear interpolation technique estimates the responses of the bad
   pixels. The second sinogram based correction method performs all the
   filtering operations in the transform domain, i.e., in the wavelet and
   Fourier domain. On the other hand, the two post-processing based
   correction techniques actually operate on the polar transform domain of
   the reconstructed CT images. The first method extracts the ring artifact
   template vector using a homogeneity test and then corrects the CT images
   by subtracting the artifact template vector from the uncorrected images.
   The second post-processing based correction technique performs median
   and mean filtering on the reconstructed images to produce the corrected
   images.
   Results: The performances of the comparing algorithms have been tested
   by using both quantitative and perceptual measures. For quantitative
   analysis, two different numerical performance indices are chosen. On the
   other hand, different types of artifact patterns, e. g., single/band
   ring, artifacts from defective and mis-calibrated detector elements,
   rings in highly structural object and also in hard object, rings from
   different flat-panel detectors are analyzed to perceptually investigate
   the strength and weakness of the five methods. An investigation has been
   also carried out to compare the efficacy of these algorithms in
   correcting the volume images from a cone beam CT with the parameters
   determined from one particular slice. Finally, the capability of each
   correction technique in retaining the image information (e. g., small
   object at the iso-center) accurately in the corrected CT image has been
   also tested.
   Conclusions: The results show that the performances of the algorithms
   are limited and none is fully suitable for correcting different types of
   ring artifacts without introducing processing distortion to the image
   structure. To achieve the diagnostic quality of the corrected slices a
   combination of the two approaches (sinogram- and post-processing) can be
   used. Also the comparing methods are not suitable for correcting the
   volume images from a cone beam flat-panel detector based CT.

AB High resolution tomographic images acquired with a digital X-ray
   detector are often degraded by the so called ring artifacts. In this
   paper, a detail analysis including the classification, detection and
   correction of these ring artifacts is presented. At first, a novel idea
   for classifying rings into two categories, namely type I and type II
   rings, is proposed based on their statistical characteristics. The
   defective detector elements and the dusty scintillator screens result in
   type I ring and the mis-calibrated detector elements lead to type II
   ring. Unlike conventional approaches, we emphasize here on the separate
   detection and correction schemes for each type of rings for their
   effective removal. For the detection of type I ring, the histogram of
   the responses of the detector elements is used and a modified fast image
   inpainting algorithm is adopted to correct the responses of the
   defective pixels. On the other hand, to detect the type II ring, first a
   simple filtering scheme is presented based on the fast Fourier transform
   (FFT) to smooth the sum curve derived form the type I ring corrected
   projection data. The difference between the sum curve and its smoothed
   version is then used to detect their positions. Then, to remove the
   constant bias suffered by the responses of the mis-calibrated detector
   elements with view angle, an estimated dc shift is subtracted from them.
   The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using real
   micro-CT images and is compared with three recently reported algorithms.

AB Concentric rings are among the most recurrent artifacts in X-ray
   computed microtomography imaging. Their presence have a negative impact
   on the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data. An interesting
   approach for ring artifacts removal is based on direct filtering of the
   reconstructed slices. Slice filtering does not require additional
   imaging data (i.e. flat fielding images), it does not exclude methods
   applied during the reconstruction process (i.e. sinogram processing) and
   it can be applied also to past archived tomographic data. In this work
   four different approaches for the removal of complete ring artifacts are
   presented and preliminary compared using a suitably created artificial
   image as well as an experimental image. After a critical analysis of the
   considered filters, the results support that an approach based on a
   modified Sijbers and Postnov [1] method effectively compensates ring
   artifacts in reconstructed slices, thus resulting in a powerful tool for
   established microtomography workflows.

   ring artifacts without introducing processing distortion to the image
   structure. To achieve the diagnostic quality of the corrected slices a
   combination of the two approaches (sinogram- and post-processing) can be
   used. Also the comparing methods are not suitable for correcting the
   volume images from a cone beam flat-panel detector based CT.

TI A Self-Adaptive Approach for the Detection and Correction of Stripes in

AB The digital X-ray detectors often generate stripe artifact in the
   sinogram which in turn creates ring artifact in the reconstructed
   micro-Computed Tomography (mu-CT), C-Arm CT, and most recent dental CT
   images. Such ring artifacts not only obscure image details in the
   regions of interest but also mask the whole image with some artifacts.
   In this paper, novel techniques are proposed for the detection and
   suppression of ring artifacts in the sinogram domain. As ring artifacts
   are manifested as edge creating stripes, single or contiguous, in the
   sinogram, they are detected based on a set of specific conditions
   derived from the second derivative of the sinogram and a new
   self-adaptive threshold computed from its first derivative. A new method
   for the detection of wide band contiguous stripes using the mean curve
   and multilevel polyphase decomposition of the given sinogram is also
   proposed here. For the correction of ring artifacts, novel variable
   window moving average (VWMA) and weighted moving average (WMA) filters
   are proposed in this work. To evaluate and compare the performance of
   the proposed algorithm, various types of synthetic and real mu-CT images
   are used. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect
   ring artifacts with high accuracy and thus remove them more effectively
   without imparting noticeable distortion in the image as compared to
   other reported techniques.

   that a sinogram is a smooth function along the horizontal spatial

AB A new image correction method based on projection sinograms is proposed
   to remove ring artifacts in industrial Computerized Tomography (CT) and
   to improve the precisions of post processing and quantitative analysis.
   A S-L filter is adopted to filter original projection data and to
   enhance artifact information. Then, the filtered projection data are
   processed by line integral and difference to further increase the
   difference between artifact edges and work piece contours. Furthermore,
   the differenced projection data are averaged according to the number of
   interpolations, and the artifact lo cation is automatically searched
   according to the threshold selected by normal distribution. Finally, the
   projection data of ring artifacts are corrected by combining the linear
   interpolation and linear extrapolation. A correction experiment is
   carried out in the actual CT images including ring artifacts. The result
   indicates that the SNR of gray image using the proposed method has
   increased by 1.688 dB, which shows that proposed method effectively
   eliminates the ring artifacts and keeps the image edges and resolution
   as compared with the methods of polar coordinate transformation or
   Wave-FFT. The proposed method is suitable for correcting the
   discontinuous ring artifacts caused by detector faults and unstable
   performance.

AB In high-resolution cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using the
   flat-panel detector, imperfect or defect detector elements cause ring
   artifacts due to the none-uniformity of their X-ray response. They often
   disturb the image quality. A dedicated fitting correction method for
   high-resolution micro-CT is presented. The method converts each
   elementary X-ray response curve to an average one, and eliminates
   response inconsistency among pixels. Other factors of the method are
   discussed, such as the correction factor variability by different
   sampling frames and nonlinear factors over the whole spectrum. Results
   show that the noise and artifacts are both reduced in reconstructed
   images.

AB A new iterative center weighted median filter (ICWMF) for ring artifact
   reduction from the micro-computed tomographic (mu-CT) image is proposed
   in this paper. The center weight of the median filter is computed based
   on the characteristic of the ring artifact in the mean curve of the
   projection data. The filter operates on the deviation of the mean curve
   to smooth the ring generating peaks and troughs iteratively while
   preserving the details due to image. A convergence criterion for the
   iterative algorithm is determined from the distribution of the local
   deviation computed from the mean curve deviation. The estimate of the
   mean curve obtained using the ICWMF is used to correct the ring
   corrupted projection data from which reconstruction gives the ring
   artifact suppressed mu-CT image. Test results on both the synthetic and
   real images demonstrate that the ring artifacts can be more effectively
   suppressed using our method as compared to other ring removal techniques
   reported in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Differences in the individual pixel response of detector elements
   introduce ring artifacts in tomographic images seriously degrading image
   quality. Removing or at least significantly reducing such artifacts is
   indispensable. In this paper an improved ring artifacts remover filter
   based on the approach of I. Sijbers and A. Postnov [1] is presented. The
   principal advantage and core characteristic of the proposed method is
   that it can be applied directly on images that have been already
   reconstructed, thus eliminating the need for additional imaging data
   like sinograms, flat fields and dark fields that are traditionally used
   for ring removal. The proposed method is computationally inexpensive and
   can be used even within established CT workflows or on past archived
   tomographic data.

   image details. The algorithm comprises two stages and is based on a
   priori information about the true attenuation coefficient in some areas

   initial stage of the algorithm can already provide good ring artifact
   suppression.

AB In flat-detector CT, imperfect or defect detector elements may cause
   concentric ring artifacts due to their continuous over-or
   underestimation of attenuation values, which often disturb image
   quality. Especially due to the demand for high-spatial resolution images
   and the necessary pixel read-out without arbitrary pixel-binning, ring
   artifacts become more pronounced and the reduction of these artifacts
   becomes a necessity. We here present a comparison of two dedicated ring
   artifact correction methods for flat-detector CT, on the basis of
   different median and mean filterings of the reconstructed image but each
   working in different geometric planes. While the first method works in
   Cartesian coordinates, the second method performs a transformation to
   polar coordinates. Both post-processing methods efficiently reduce ring
   artifacts in the reconstructed images and improve image quality. The
   transformation to polar coordinates turned out to be a necessary step
   for efficient ring artifact correction, since correction in Cartesian
   coordinates suffers from newly introduced artifacts as well as
   insufficient correction of artifacts close to the center of rotation.

AB Cone-beam CT (CBCT) scanners are based on volumetric tomography, using a
   2D extended digital array providing an area detector [1]. Compared to
   traditional CT, CBCT has many advantages, such as less X-ray beam
   limitation, high image accuracy, rapid scan time, etc. However, in CBCT
   images there are always some ring artifacts that appear as rings
   centered on the rotation axis. Due to the data of the constructed images
   are corrupted by these ring artifacts, qualitative and quantitative
   analysis of CBCT images will be compromised. Post processing and
   application such as image segmentation and registration also turn more
   complex as the presence of such artifacts. In this paper, a method based
   on independent component analysis (ICA) is presented. It deals with the
   reconstructed CBCT image and can effectively reduce such ring artifacts.

AB Ring artifacts in computed tomography (CT) images are introduced by
   imperfect pixel channel in a detector. Ring artifacts degrade the CT
   image, hamper post processing and prohibit quantitative analysis. A set
   of algorithms that enable virtually complete ring artifact correction
   were proposed. Correction for pixel channel response nonuniformity was
   that offset and gain correction were done to compensate for response
   non- uniformity in the detector. Correction for projection sinogram data
   was that the vertical line artifacts in the sonogram were removed by a
   computationally efficient filter. Correction for already-reconstructed
   images was that the ring artifacts in the Cartesian coordinate were
   transformed into the vertical line artifacts in the polar coordinate and
   removed as sonogram correction. The procedures were created to deal with
   data acquired from an YXLON XRS232 9" image intensifier. Ring artifacts
   were reduced significantly with minimal to negligible contamination of
   the underlying data.

AB Tomographic images are often superimposed by so called ring artefacts.
   Ring artefacts are concentric rings in the images around the center of
   rotation of the tomographic setup caused e.g. by differences in the
   individual pixel response of the detector. They complicate the post
   processing of the data, i.e. the segmentation of individual image
   information. Hence, for a quantitative analysis of the tomographic
   images a significant reduction of these artefacts is essential. In this
   paper, a simple but efficient method to eliminate such artefacts during
   the reconstruction is proposed.

   negligible contamination of the underlying data. These procedures were
   created specifically to deal with data as acquired at the University of
   Texas high-resolution X-ray CT facility, but are likely to be applicable
   in other settings as well. In most cases corrections are optimally
   applied to sinogram data before reconstruction, but a variant is
   developed for correcting already-reconstructed images. The algorithms
   make particular use of repetitive aspects of the artifact across images
   to improve behavior. However, fully utilizing this functionality
   requires processing entire data sets simultaneously, rather than one
   image at a time. A number of parameters may be adjusted to optimize
   results for particular data sets.

AB Ring artifacts can occur in reconstructed images from X-ray
   microtomography as full or partial circles centred on the rotation axis.
   In this paper, a 2D method is proposed that reduces these ring artifacts
   in the reconstructed images. The method consists of two main parts.
   First, the artifacts are localised in the image using local orientation
   estimation of the image structures and filtering to find ring patterns
   in the orientation information. Second, the map of the located artifacts
   is used to calculate a correction image using normalised convolution.
   The method is evaluated on 2D images from volume data of paper fibre
   imaged at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) with high
   resolution X-ray microtomography. The results show that the proposed
   method reduces the artifacts and restores the pixel values for all types
   of partial and complete ring artifacts where the signal is not
   completely saturated.
