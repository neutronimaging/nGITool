	Abstract = {The Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) of Lambert-Beer's attenuation
	approximation for parallel rays transmission projection is a variant
	of the ART model that aims to solve image reconstruction problems
	in nuclear based computed tomography for non-destructive testing
	where gamma or kappa radiation is used as a ray source. In this model,
	the path length of the ray that hits a pixel at any projection view
	and the size of detector grid are explicitly included in computation.
	Then, the model is used to investigate the influence of the ray path
	length and the width of detector grid in producing image quality.
	The image quality is represented as space and pixel resolution, respectively.
	In this paper, we demonstrate that the model is able to show the
	contribution of the ray path length and detector grid in producing
	image quality. By considering ray path length and detector grid,
	the model produces smaller Root Mean Square error compared to conventional
	ART.},

	Abstract = {Studies have shown that aortic calcification is associated with increased
	risk of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, aortic calcium assessment
	can be performed on standard cardiac calcium scoring Computed Tomography
	scans, which may help to avoid additional imaging studies. In this
	paper, we present an entropy-based, narrow band restricted, iterative
	method for segmentation of the ascending aorta in non-contrast CT
	images, as a step towards aortic calcification detection and pericardial
	fat quantitation. First, an estimate of the aorta center and radius
	is obtained by applying dynamic programming in Hough space. In the
	second step, these estimates serve to reduce the aorta boundary search
	area to within a narrow band, and the contour is updated iteratively
	using dynamic programming methods. Our algorithm is able to overcome
	the limitations of previous approaches in characterizing (i) the
	boundary edge features and (ii) non-circular shape at aortic root.
	The results from the proposed method compare favorably with the manually
	traced aorta boundaries and outperform other approaches in terms
	of boundary distance and volume overlap.},

	Abstract = {Recognition of anatomical structures is an important step in model
	based medical image segmentation. It provides pose estimation of
	objects and information about "where" roughly the objects are in
	the image and distinguishing them from other object-like entities.
	In,1 we presented a general method of model-based multi-object recognition
	to assist in segmentation (delineation) tasks. It exploits the pose
	relationship that can be encoded, via the concept of ball scale (b-scale),
	between the binary training objects and their associated grey images.
	The goal was to place the model, in a single shot, close to the right
	pose (position, orientation, and scale) in a given image so that
	the model boundaries fall in the close vicinity of object boundaries
	in the image. Unlike position and scale parameters, we observe that
	orientation parameters require more attention when estimating the
	pose of the model as even small differences in orientation parameters
	can lead to inappropriate recognition. Motivated from the non-Euclidean
	nature of the pose information, we propose in this paper the use
	of non-Euclidean metrics to estimate orientation of the anatomical
	structures for more accurate recognition and segmentation. We statistically
	analyze and evaluate the following metrics for orientation estimation:
	Euclidean, Log-Euclidean, Root-Euclidean, Procrustes Size-and-Shape,
	and mean Hermitian metrics. The results show that mean Hermitian
	and Cholesky decomposition metrics provide more accurate orientation
	estimates than other Euclidean and non-Euclidean metrics.},

@article{burger11,
	Abstract = {For digital photographs of astronomical objects, where exposure times
	are usually long and ISO settings high, the so-called dark-current
	is a significant source of noise. Dark-current refers to thermally
	generated electrons and is therefore present even in the absence
	of light. This paper presents a novel approach for denoising astronomical
	images that have been corrupted by dark-current noise. Our method
	relies on a probabilistic description of the dark-current of each
	pixel of a given camera. The noise model is then combined with an
	image prior which is adapted to astronomical images. In a laboratory
	environment, we use a black and white CCD camera containing a cooling
	unit and show that our method is superior to existing methods in
	terms of root mean squared error. Furthermore, we show that our method
	is practically relevant by providing visually more appealing results
	on astronomical photographs taken with a single lens reflex CMOS

@article{burns11,
	Abstract = {The development and adoption of standard image quality measurement
	and analysis methods have helped both the evaluation of competing
	imaging products and in technologies. Inherent in the interpretation
	of results from any particular evaluation, however, are the variation
	of the method itself, the sampling of test images, equipment, and
	test conditions. Here we take a statistical approach to measurement
	variation, and interpret the objective as being the estimation of
	particular system or image properties, based on data, collected as
	part of standard testing. Measurement variation was investigated
	for two signal-transfer methods commonly used for digital camera
	and scanner evaluation: the ISO 12233 slanted-edge spatial frequency
	response and the dead-leaves method for texture-MTF evaluation being
	developed by the Camera Phone Image Quality (CPIQ) Initiative. In
	each case, the variation due to the selection of analysis regions
	was computed by repeated analysis. The slanted-edge methods indicated
	a relative error in the range of 1-3% depending on the nature of
	the region selection. For the dead-leaves method, the amplitude spectrum
	(square root of the noise-power spectrum) showed a relative error
	of approximately 4-6%, however, this can be reduced by applying spectral
	estimation methods commonly used in image noise analysis.},

@article{delibasis10,
	Abstract = {An automatic algorithm capable of segmenting the whole vessel tree
	and calculate vessel diameter and orientation in a digital ophthalmologic
	image is presented in this work. The algorithm is based on a parametric
	model of a vessel that can assume arbitrarily complex shape and a
	simple measure of match that quantifies how well the vessel model
	matches a given angiographic image. An automatic vessel tracing algorithm
	is described that exploits the geometric model and actively seeks
	vessel bifurcation, without user intervention. The proposed algorithm
	uses the geometric vessel model to determine the vessel diameter
	at each detected central axis pixel. For this reason, the algorithm
	is fine tuned using a subset of ophthalmologic images of the publically
	available DRIVE database, by maximizing vessel segmentation accuracy.
	The proposed algorithm is then applied to the remaining ophthalmological
	images of the DRIVE database. The segmentation results of the proposed
	algorithm compare favorably in terms of accuracy with six other well
	established vessel detection techniques, outperforming three of them
	in the majority of the available ophthalmologic images. The proposed
	algorithm achieves subpixel root mean square central axis positioning
	error that outperforms the non-expert based vessel segmentation,
	whereas the accuracy of vessel diameter estimation is comparable
	to that of the non-expert based vessel segmentation. (C) 2010 Elsevier

@article{felipussi08,
	Abstract = {Porous media modeling is relevant in several applications, such as
	agricultural engineering, where soil compaction analysis requires
	the estimation of soil transport properties. For example, the prediction
	of root growing patterns and their environmental impact is usually
	measured by analyzing soil fluid infiltration capacity and water
	retention. Recently, tomographic images have been used in nondestructive
	tests of soil. However, using such images is challenging for two
	reasons: 1) Tomographic images are usually noisy, which complicates
	their segmentation, and 2) modeling the soil structure requires establishing
	adjacency relations among neighboring tomographic slices, which has
	a significant computational cost due to the combinatorial nature
	of this problem. In this paper, we propose a solution for both problems.
	The experimental results show that soil samples can be analyzed and

	using a particle filter tracker, normally applied to object tracking
	though time, to trace along a root in an image. The samples the particle
	filter generates are used to build a probabilistic graph across the
	root location in the image, and this is traversed to produce a final
	estimate of length. The software is compared to real-world and artificial

	Abstract = {Image interpolation is intrinsically a severely under-determined inverse
	problem. Traditional non-adaptive methods utilize certain models
	that fail to respect local image statistics around edges of image
	structures. In practice, this results in artifacts such as jagged
	edges and/or blurring. To overcome this short-coming, the concept
	of edge-directed interpolation has been introduced in different forms.
	One interesting variant, New Edge Directed Interpolation (NEDI) [9],
	has successfully exploited the ldquogeometric dualityrdquo that linked
	between the low-resolution (LR) image and its corresponding high-resolution
	(HR) image. It has been demonstrated that, for scalar images, NEDI
	is able to produce better results than non-adaptive traditional methods,
	both visually and quantitatively. In this work, we return to the
	root of NEDI as a least-squares estimation method of neighborhood
	patterns, and propose a robust scheme to improve it. The improvement
	comes two-folds: firstly, a robust least-squares technique is used
	to improve NEDI's performance to noise; secondly, the NEDI algorithm
	is extended with the recently proposed Non-Local Mean (NLM) estimation
	scheme. Moreover, the edge-directed concept is applied to the interpolation
	of multivalued diffusion weighted images (DWI). The framework is
	tested on phantom scalar images and real diffusion images, and is
	shown to be able to achieve better results than the non-adaptive
	methods, in terms of visual quality as well as quantitative measures.},

	of a rice root. The first one has been established for conducting
	semi-automatic analysis of growth characteristics of a rice root,
	such as root length, area, and inclination angle, by using the image
	sequence processing. The second one is proposed for effective visualization
	of characteristics that are analyzing by first techniques. For instance,
	it can compare the graphs that represent characteristics of large
	amounts of samples. This has been achieved by making the graphs translucent

	Abstract = {High-throughput phenotyping of crop root system architecture using
	digital image analysis requires costly special software (WinRHIZO).
	Novel freeware, ImageJ, has also been developed for the similar purpose,
	but the presetting of the threshold to create root binary images
	makes this method time-consuming. This study compares the 16 algorithms
	available in the ImageJ for processing of rice root images. Among
	the algorithms, the Triangle algorithm proved to be the best binary
	method, where the coefficient of correlation between ImageJ-estimated
	and WinRHIZO-estimated root lengths is extremely high (r = 0.986).
	However, using the Triangle algorithm, ImageJ overestimated the rice
	root length compared with WinRHIZO. By multiplying the values obtained
	using ImageJ by 2/3, the estimates closely corresponded to those
	estimated by WinRHIZO. The correspondence of root lengths estimated
	using WinRHIZO and ImageJ with Triangle algorithm was valid for roots
	of various morphologies, and for rice plants grown in uplands, rainfed
	lowlands, and irrigated lowlands. This report proposes the completely
	automated estimation of rice root length using freeware ImageJ with

	Abstract = {We develop a concept for the median filtering of tensor data. The
	main part of this concept is the definition of median for symmetric
	matrices. This definition is based on the minimisation of a geometrically
	motivated objective function which measures the sum of distances
	of a variable matrix to the given data matrices. This theoretically
	well-founded concept fits into a context of similarly defined median
	filters for other multivariate data. Unlike some other approaches,
	we do not require by definition that the median has to be one of
	the given data values. Nevertheless, it happens so in many cases,
	equipping the matrix-valued median even with root signals similar
	to the scalar-valued situation. Like their scalar-valued counterparts,
	matrix-valued median filters show excellent capabilities for structure-preserving
	denoising. Experiments on diffusion tensor imaging, fluid dynamics
	and orientation estimation data are shown to demonstrate this. The
	orientation estimation examples give rise to a new variant of a robust
	adaptive structure tensor which can be compared to existing concepts.
	For the efficient computation of matrix medians, we present a convex
	programming framework. By generalising the idea of the matrix median
	filters, we design a variety of other local matrix filters. These
	include matrix-valued mid-range filters and, more generally, M-smoothers

	Abstract = {Background and Aims The capacity of a plant to absorb and transport
	water and nutrients depends on anatomical structures within the roots
	and their co-ordination. However, most descriptions of root anatomical
	structure are limited to 2-D cross-sections, providing little information
	on 3-D spatial relationships and hardly anything on their temporal
	evolution. Three-dimensional reconstruction and visualization of
	root anatomical structures can illustrate spatial co-ordination among
	cells and tissues and provide new insights and understanding of the
	interrelation between structure and function. Methods Classical paraffin
	serial-section methods, image processing, computer-aided 3-D reconstruction
	and 3-D visualization techniques were combined to analyse spatial
	relationships among metaxylem vessels, passage cells and lateral
	roots in nodal roots of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). Key Results
	3-D reconstruction demonstrated that metaxylem vessels were neither
	parallel, nor did they run directly along the root axis from the
	root base to the root tip; rather they underwent substitution and
	transition. Most vessels were connected to pre-existent or newly
	formed vessels by pits on their lateral walls. The spatial distributions
	of both passage cells and lateral roots exhibited similar position-dependent
	patterns. In the transverse plane, the passage cells occurred opposite
	the poles of the protoxylem and the lateral roots opposite those
	of the protophloem. Along the axis of a young root segment, the passage
	cells were arranged in short and discontinuous longitudinal files,
	thus as the tissues mature, the sequence in which the passage cells
	lose their transport function is not basipetal. In older segments,
	passage cells decreased drastically in number and coexisted with
	lateral roots. The spatial distribution of lateral roots was similar
	to that of the passage cells, mirroring their similar functions as
	lateral pathways for water and nutrient transport to the stele. Conclusions
	With the 3-D reconstruction and visualization techniques developed
	here, the spatial relationships between vessels, passage cells and
	lateral roots and the temporal evolution of these relationships can
	be described. The technique helps to illustrate synchronization and
	spatial co-ordination among the root's radial and axial pathways
	for water and nutrient transport and the interdependence of structure
	and function in the root.},

	are, however, the least understood of all plant roots. A sensitivity
	analysis of several software programs capable of providing root diameter
	distribution analyses was undertaken to determine if this software
	was capable of discriminating 10% changes in diameters of roots in
	the 0.05-0.2 mm diameter range. Digital images produced by drawing
	discrete lines, by scanning wires of various diameters, and by scanning
	roots from several legume species were analyzed and compared. None

	Each introduced artifacts into the data that were severe enough to
	confound interpretation of the resulting diameter class length histograms
	at resolutions from 24 to 400 pixels (px) mm(-1), and root diameters
	from 0.06 to 0. 5 mm or larger. One package was, however, clearly
	superior to the other two for routine digital analysis. All three
	packages require additional development before they are suitable
	for routine analysis of fine roots. Due to the 252 px mm-1 resolution
