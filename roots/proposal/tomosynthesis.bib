  abstract = {Objectives: To describe three-dimension (3-D) tomosynthesis and cone
	beam computed tomography (CBCT) as an intraoperative imaging system
	to guide both sinus and skull-base surgery in a cadaveric model.
	Methods: Five cadaveric heads underwent baseline CBCT imaging. Surgical
	targets were resected from each head (uncinectomy, ethmoidectomy,
	medial maxillectomy, pituitary gland resection, and clivus ablation).
	Intraoperative imaging was provided so that for a given task, the
	acquisition arc (theta(tot) = 20 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees,
	90 degrees, 178 degrees) of the tomosynthesis scan was fixed. Different
	heads and tasks were allocated different acquisition angles. There
	was no limit to the number of scans that could be requested. Residual
	target was highlighted with 3-D visualization software. Results:
	The larger the image acquisition angle, the better the image. Only
	CBCT (theta(tot) similar to 178 degrees) provided nearly isotropic
	3-D spatial resolution and soft-tissue visibility in all three views.
	The volume of residual tissue remaining and the volume of adjacent-normal
	tissue that was resected were calculated as a function of tomosynthesis
	angle. For the easier surgical tasks (uncinectomy, ethmoidectomy)
	the residual tissue was not related to the tomosynthesis angle. However,
	for the difficult ablative tasks, the image quality became more important
	and tomosynthesis angle was related to the residual tissue. Conclusions:
	We describe an intraoperative imaging platform that can deliver near-real-time
	images of the target and related structures with low radiation dose.
	Tomosynthesis scanning angles higher than 60 degrees provided quantifiable
	benefits to the surgeon and facilitated total target ablation while
	helping to spare surrounding structures.},

  abstract = {The utilization of computer assisted tomography (CT or CAT-scan) as
	general non-destructive examination (NDE) technique and as research
	tool for scientists in South Africa, is limited due to the relative
	unavailability, or nonexistence of such specialized analytical equipment.
	Many medical hospitals are equipped with X-ray CT scanners for the
	diagnostic examination of patients but do not easily allow paleontologist
	or other scientist to utilize their very expensive equipment. As
	from 2003, Necsa hosts the South African Neutron Radiography (SANRAD)
	and:tomography facility where neutrons from the SAFARI-1 nuclear
	research reactor and their penetrating power as well as X-rays as
	a complementing tool, are utilized in many R\&D applications: This
	facility is being made available to HEI and specifically utilized
	by postgraduate students as part of their studies and/or by industry
	on an ad hoc commercial basis. The capability of these radiation
	imaging facilities at Necsa will be demonstrated in areas such as
	paleontology, geosciences and specifically the physical properties
	of rock and the distribution of minerals in borehole cores, petrophysics
	to predict the percentage tar/oil/water content within sandstone
	samples and others. The penetration capability of neutrons through
	specimens with a matrix of high atomic number (dense materials) and
	their ability to be attenuated by low atomic number material (light
	density) makes neutron imaging complementary to X-ray imaging. The
	capability of X-ray and gamma radiation for relatively easy penetration
	through specimens of low atomic number allows for viewing of imbedded
	high atomic number materials and density variation. X-ray micro focus
	radiography is capable of resolving objects of micro scale size that
	are micro distances apart whereas Xray phase contrast radiography
	utilizes the wave properties of the. electromagnetic spectrum of
	X-rays to clearly define edges of the specimen under investigation.
	Many applications with neutrons as imaging probe are successfully
	applied at several facilities across the globe such as at NIST in
	USA, Neutra at PSI-in Switzerland, and ANTARES at FRM2 in Germany,
	etc, are documented(4-9), through world conferences on neutron radiography,
	for example; This is achieved through very well thought through and
	implemented instrumentation from the production of neutrons-to their
	detection and interpretation of the images. The need arose at Necsa
	to upgrade the current facility from 42-year-old technology, which
	was successfully applied in neutron imaging over the past 10 years,
	to state-of-the-art technology found at European facilities. This
	initiative started under the auspices of an IAEA-TC programme for
	the period 2007-2010.},

  month = {Jan},
  abstract = {When an imaging task is specified, the design of a cone-beam CT scanner
	includes specifications of the scanning trajectory and corresponding
	image reconstruction algorithms, requirements on the detector size,
	and requirements on the x-ray tubes. Given the limited flat-panel
	detector readout speed and the need of short scanning time in a clinical
	setting, the available number of total view angles is normally limited
	to several hundred. It is known that when all the focal spots are
	distributed along a circular trajectory, the cone-beam artifacts
	are present in the reconstructed out-of-plane images when the cone-angle
	is relatively large. In order to mitigate or eliminate the cone-beam
	artifacts, the source trajectory should be complete in the sense
	of satisfying the so-called Tuy data sufficiency condition. However,
	assuming a constant number of view angles, a complete source trajectory
	will potentially lead to a lower view sampling rate and cause view
	aliasing artifacts. Therefore, for a given imaging task and a given
	total number of view angles, it is important to study the tradeoff
	between the view sampling rate and the completeness of the scanning
	source trajectories. In this paper, we numerically and experimentally
	studied the above tradeoff. Specifically, numerical simulations were
	conducted to study this tradeoff using three different source trajectories:
	(1) a circular trajectory, (2) a helical trajectory, and (3) a two-concentric-orthogonal-circle
	trajectory. A single x-ray tube and a flat panel imager mounted on
	an optical bench was utilized to experimentally study the tradeoff
	between the circular source trajectory and the helical source trajectory.
	For the complete source trajectories, some novel cone-beam image
	reconstruction algorithms have been utilized to reconstruct images
	and compare image quality in numerical simulations and benchtop experiments.},

  abstract = {Image reconstruction from projections is the field that lays the foundations
	for computed tomography (CT). For several decades, the established
	principles were applied not only to medical scanners in radiology
	and nuclear medicine but also to industrial scanning. When speaking
	of image reconstruction from projections, one is generally considering
	the problem of recovering some density function from measurements
	taken over straight lines, or the ``line-integral model'' for short.
	Image reconstruction can be performed by directly applying analytic
	formulas derived from the theory or by using general optimization
	methods adapted to handling large linear systems. The latter techniques
	are referred to as iterative to distinguish them from the analytic
	(or direct) methods. This article considers only the analytic methods.
	The two-dimensional (2-D) reconstruction problem (or classical tomography)
	refers to a density function in two dimensions with measurement lines
	lying in the plane, and the three-dimensional (3-D) problem considers
	3-D density functions and lines with arbitrary orientations in space.
	The widely used term 3-D imaging is potentially confusing in this
	context, because there are some 3-D forms of image reconstruction
	that are mathematically equivalent to performing 2-D reconstruction
	on a set of parallel contiguous planes. To emphasize the distinction
	between 2-D and 3-D reconstruction, the terminology fully 3-D image
	reconstruction (or sometimes truly 3-D reconstruction) was introduced
	in the late 1980s when there seemed to be very little left to do
	in two dimensions but a rich unexplored 3-D theory to be developed.},

  abstract = {Purpose: In comparison with conventional filtered backprojection (FBP)
	algorithms for x-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction,
	statistical algorithms directly incorporate the random nature of
	the data and do not assume CT data are linear, noiseless functions
	of the attenuation line integral. Thus, it has been hypothesized
	that statistical image reconstruction may support a more favorable
	tradeoff than FBP between image noise and spatial resolution in dose-limited
	applications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the noise-resolution
	tradeoff for the alternating minimization (AM) algorithm regularized
	using a nonquadratic penalty function. Methods: Idealized monoenergetic
	CT projection data with Poisson noise were simulated for two phantoms
	with inserts of varying contrast (7\%-238\%) and distance from the
	field-of-view (FOV) center (2-6.5 cm). Images were reconstructed
	for the simulated projection data by the FBP algorithm and two penalty
	function parameter values of the penalized AM algorithm. Each algorithm
	was run with a range of smoothing strengths to allow quantification
	of the noise-resolution tradeoff curve. Image noise is quantified
	as the standard deviation in the water background around each contrast
	insert. Modulation transfer functions (MTFs) were calculated from
	six-parameter model fits to oversampled edge-spread functions defined
	by the circular contrast-insert edges as a metric of local resolution.
	The integral of the MTF up to 0.5 lp/mm was adopted as a single-parameter
	measure of local spatial resolution. Results: The penalized AM algorithm
	noise-resolution tradeoff curve was always more favorable than that
	of the FBP algorithm. While resolution and noise are found to vary
	as a function of distance from the FOV center differently for the
	two algorithms, the ratio of noises when matching the resolution
	metric is relatively uniform over the image. The ratio of AM-to-FBP
	image variances, a predictor of dose-reduction potential, was strongly
	dependent on the shape of the AM's nonquadratic penalty function
	and was also strongly influenced by the contrast of the insert for
	which resolution is quantified. Dose-reduction potential, reported
	here as the fraction (\%) of FBP dose necessary for AM to reconstruct
	an image with comparable noise and resolution, for one penalty parameter
	value of the AM algorithm was found to vary from 70\% to 50\% for
	low-contrast and high-contrast structures, respectively, and from
	70\% to 10\% for the second AM penalty parameter value. However,
	the second penalty, AM-700, was found to suffer from poor low-contrast
	resolution when matching the high-contrast resolution metric with
	FBP. Conclusions: The results of this simulation study imply that
	penalized AM has the potential to reconstruct images with similar
	noise and resolution using a fraction (10\%-70\%) of the FBP dose.
	However, this dose-reduction potential depends strongly on the AM
	penalty parameter and the contrast magnitude of the structures of
	interest. In addition, the authors' results imply that the advantage
	of AM can be maximized by optimizing the nonquadratic penalty function
	to the specific imaging task of interest. Future work will extend
	the methods used here to quantify noise and resolution in images
	reconstructed from real CT data. (C) 2011 American Association of

	(WF) algorithm. Each of the IQ and anthropomorphic phantoms is scanned
	twice using GE Lightspeed 16. The first scans, where the phantoms
	are positioned inside the 50 cm DFOV, are used to establish the ``ground
	truth''; while in the 2nd scans, the phantoms are positioned in such
	way that the edges are 4-8 cm outside the 50 cm DFOV. For quantitative
	assessment, a point of interest within 50 cm DFOV is chosen for each
	phantom, to which the accumulative attenuation in all views is calculated
	as a lst-order approximation of dose to be delivered to the point.
	The performance of the algorithms is evaluated by accumulative attenuation
	accuracy by comparing with the ``ground truth''. In reconstruction
	from all three algorithms, objects outside 50 cm DFOV are restored

	The SM reconstruction results in restoration of low-attenuating objects

	objects in large truncation cases is limited and produces worst attenuation
	accuracy due to the overly simplicity of the algorithm. The SI algorithm

	depart from the ground truth due to the lack of consistency in sinogram
	interpolation. WF produces significantly better image quality and
	>17\% higher accuracy than SM and SI in all cases. In summary, it
	is feasible to extend the CT DFOV with algorithmic corrections. Among

	To maintain short acquisition time, the detector must have a rapid
	temporal response. Transient effects like lag and ghosting have been
	noted previously in digital mammography systems, but for the times
	between successive views (approx. 1 minute), their impact on image
	quality is generally negligible. However, tomosynthesis imaging requires
	much shorter times between projection images (< 1 s). Under these

	may not be suitable for tomosynthesis. Transient effects will generally

	CT, provides excellent visualization of the internal organs of the

	obtain three- and four-dimensional data. Data is obtained by exposing
	patients to a beam of x-rays from a number (about 1000) of different
	angles (projections). Then, standard CT makes use of the Radon transform
	to generate 3D data, denoted (f) over right arrow, directly from
	projections, denoted (g) over right arrow. Thus, the projection relationship
	can be represented in matrix form by (g) over right arrow = M (f)
	over right arrow where M represents the projection matrix. Note that
	techniques based on the Radon transform are in general limited by
	the Nyquist sampling criteria. The increasing use of CT has resulted
	in a substantial rise in population-radiation-dose [1], which may
	lead to an increased incidence of cancer in the population. In addition
	to increased use, the number of projections in the CT acquisitions
	is increasing to improve image quality which further increases patient
	radiation exposure as well as the reconstruction time. This latter
	issue can be improved by using new technology, e.g., graphical processing
	units (GPUs) [2], but the problem of radiation dose does remains.
	Reduction of the number of projections can result in artifacts and

	classical Nyquist sampling rule yields the minimum number of projection
	views required for accurate reconstruction. However, challenges exist
	in many medical and industrial imaging applications in which the
	projection data is undersampled. Classical analytical reconstruction
	methods such as FBP are not a good choice for use in such cases because
	the data undersampling in the angular range introduces aliasing and
	streak artifacts that degrade lesion detectability. In this paper,
	we propose a Bayesian framework for ML-EM-based iterative reconstruction
	methods that incorporates a priori knowledge obtained from expected
	intensity information. The proposed framework is based on the fact
	that, in tomographic imaging, it is often possible to expect a set
	of intensity values of the reconstructed object with relatively high
	accuracy. The image reconstruction cost function is modified to include
	the lscr 1 norm distance to the a priori known information. The proposed
	method has the potential to regularize the solution to reduce artifacts

  abstract = {Compresssed sensing seems to be very promising for image reconstruction
	in computed tomography. In the last years it has been shown, that
	these algorithms are able to handle incomplete data sets quite well.
	As cost function these algorithms use the l(1)-norm of the image
	after it has been transformed by a sparsifying transformation. This
	yields to an inequality-constrained convex optimization problem.
	Due to the large size of the optimization problem some heuristic
	optimization algorithms have been proposed in the last years. The
	most popular way is optimizing the rawdata and sparsity cost functions
	separately in an alternating manner. In this paper we will follow
	this strategy. Thereby we present a new method to adapt these optimization
	steps. Compared to existing methods which perform similar, the proposed
	method needs no a priori knowledge about the rawdata consistency.
	It is ensured that the algorithm converges to the best possible value
	of the rawdata cost function, while holding the sparsity constraint
	at a low value. This is achieved by transferring both optimization
	procedures into the rawdata domain, where they are adapted to each
	other. To evaluate the algorithm, we process measured clinical datasets.
	To cover a wide field of possible applications, we focus on the problems
	of angular undersampling, data lost due to metal implants, limited
	view angle tomography and interior tomography. In all cases the presented
	method reaches convergence within less than 25 iteration steps, while
	using a constant set of algorithm control parameters. The image artifacts
	caused by incomplete rawdata are mostly removed without introducing
	new effects like staircasing. All scenarios are compared to an existing
	implementation of the ASD-POCS algorithm, which realizes the stepsize
	adaption in a different way. Additional prior information as proposed
	by the PICCS algorithm can be incorporated easily into the optimization

  abstract = {Breast tomosynthesis is a 3-dimensional (3-D) imaging technology that
	involves acquiring images of a stationary compressed breast at multiple
	angles during a short scan. The individual images are then reconstructed
	into a series of thin high-resolution slices that displayed individually
	or in a dynamic cine mode. Tomosynthesis can reduce or eliminate
	the tissue overlap effect. While holding the breast stationary, images
	are acquired at a nsumber of different x-ray source angles. Objects
	at different heights in the breast project differently for each angle.
	The final step in the tomosynthesis procedure is reconstructing the
	data to generate images that enhance objects from a given height
	by appropriate shifting of the projections relative to one another.
	There are 3 specific areas in tomosynthesis system requirements that
	warrant a closer review: detector efficiency and dose, field of view,
	and equipment geometry. The breast is compressed in a standard way.
	While holding the breast stationary, the x-ray tube is rotated over
	a limited angular range. A series of low dose exposures are made
	every few degrees, creating a series of digital images. Typically,
	the tuben is rotated about +/-15 degrees, and 11 exposures are made
	every 3 degrees during a total scan of a few seconds. The individual
	images are projections through the breast at different angles and
	these arewhat are reconstructed into slices. There are 2 basic tomosynthesis
	system designs that diiffer in the motion of the detector during
	acquisition. One method moves the detector in concert with the x-ray
	tube so as to maintain the shadow of the breast on the detector.
	An altemate method is to keep the detector stationary relative to
	the breast platform. The tomosynthesis reconstruction process consists
	of computing high-resolution images whose planes are parallel to

	This system can be classified as producing severely limited data,

	suitable a priori information. In the new method, a 2-D discrete
	wavelet transform has been used as a smoothing function. We present
	a method of designing the optimal wavelet-based smoothing function,
	depending on a priori knowledge of the subject. The significance
	of the particular wavelet filter selected is considered in terms

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with limited view tomography. Inspired by
	the application of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), which is but
	one of an increasing number of applications of limited view tomography,
	we concentrate primarily on cases where the angular range is restricted
	to a narrow wedge of approximately +/- 30 degrees, and the number
	of views is restricted to 10-30. The main challenge posed by these
	conditions is undersampling, also known as the null space problem.
	As a consequence of the Fourier Slice Theorem, a limited angular
	range leaves large swathes of the object's Fourier space unsampled,
	leaving a large space of possible solutions, reconstructed volumes,
	for a given set of inputs. We explore the feasibility of using same-
	or different-modality images as anatomical priors to constrain the
	null space, hence the solution. To allow for different-modality priors,
	we choose information theoretic measures to quantify the similarity
	between reconstructions and their priors. We demonstrate the limitations
	of two popular choices, namely mutual information and joint entropy,
	and propose robust alternatives that overcome their limitations.
	One of these alternatives is essentially a joint mixture model of
	the image and its prior. Promising mitigation of the data insufficiency
	problem is demonstrated using 2D synthetic as well as clinical phantoms.
	This work initially assumes a priori registered priors, and is then
	extended to allow for the registration to be performed simultaneously
	with the reconstruction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Purpose: An iterative tomographic reconstruction algorithm that simultaneously
	segments and reconstructs the reconstruction domain is proposed and
	applied to tomographic reconstructions from a sparse number of projection
	images. Methods: The proposed algorithm uses a two-phase level set
	method segmentation in conjunction with an iterative tomographic
	reconstruction to achieve simultaneous segmentation and reconstruction.
	The simultaneous segmentation and reconstruction is achieved by alternating
	between level set function evolutions and per-region intensity value
	updates. To deal with the limited number of projections, a priori
	information about the reconstruction is enforced via penalized likelihood
	function. Specifically, smooth function within each region (piecewise
	smooth function) and bounded function intensity values for each region
	are assumed. Such a priori information is formulated into a quadratic
	objective function with linear bound constraints. The level set function
	evolutions are achieved by artificially time evolving the level set
	function in the negative gradient direction; the intensity value
	updates are achieved by using the gradient projection conjugate gradient
	algorithm. Results: The proposed simultaneous segmentation and reconstruction
	results were compared to ``conventional'' iterative reconstruction
	(with no segmentation), iterative reconstruction followed by segmentation,
	and filtered backprojection. Improvements of 6\%-13\% in the normalized
	root mean square error were observed when the proposed algorithm
	was applied to simulated projections of a numerical phantom and to
	real fan-beam projections of the Catphan phantom, both of which did
	not satisfy the a priori assumptions. Conclusions: The proposed simultaneous
	segmentation and reconstruction resulted in improved reconstruction
	image quality. The algorithm correctly segments the reconstruction
	space into regions, preserves sharp edges between different regions,
	and smoothes the noise within each region. The proposed algorithm
	framework has the flexibility to be adapted to different a priori
	constraints while maintaining the benefits achieved by the simultaneous
	segmentation and reconstruction.},

	projections, the reconstructed image will contain truncation artifacts
	- bright rings on the boundary of region of interest (ROI). Extrapolation
	algorithms can be used to reduce the truncation artifacts; however
	extrapolations are usually double the length of the projection data;
	resulting in an increased calculation time. This paper introduces
	mixed extrapolation, which is a combination of exponential and quadratic
	extrapolation. It is proven that doubling the length of the projection
	data for the mixed extrapolation can be avoided. The projections
	were extrapolated according to the boundary values and their derivatives.
	The algorithm achieves equivalence to the extrapolation approach
	with negligible increased calculation time. Supplementary functions
	are introduced in order to simplify the calculations. These functions
	can be calculated prior to extrapolation process, hence the calculation
	time is significantly reduced. The calculation times are compared
	between fast extrapolation introduced in this paper and normal extrapolation
	with doubling the length of projection data.},

  abstract = {It was shown that images reconstructed for transmission tomography
	with iterative maximum likelihood (ML) algorithms exhibit a higher
	signal-to-noise ratio than images reconstructed with filtered back-projection
	type algorithms. However, a drawback of ML reconstruction in particular
	and iterative reconstruction in general is the requirement that the
	reconstructed field of view (FOV) has to cover the whole volume that
	contributes to the absorption. In the case of a high resolution reconstruction,
	this demands a huge number of voxels. This article shows how an iterative
	ML reconstruction can be limited to a region of interest (ROI) without
	losing the advantages of a ML reconstruction. Compared with a full
	FOV ML reconstruction, the reconstruction speed is mainly increased
	by reducing the number of voxels which are necessary for a ROI reconstruction.
	In addition, the speed of convergence is increased. (C) 2008 American
